# Console Application: Geometric Figures

This README provides an overview of the directory structure and contents of the project, outlining the purpose and organization of each folder.

## Folder Structure

1. **src**:

   - Contains the source code files of the project, including modules, classes and functions.

2. **headers**:
   - Contains the header code files of the project.


## C++ Object Files Summary

This repository contains C++ object files representing various geometric shapes and lines. For each choice of the shape a `.gp` file will be generated which will have the representation for the shape created.

Below is a brief summary of each file:

### Circle.cpp

Contains the implementation of a `Circle` class with methods to calculate area and circumference.

### Ellipse.cpp

Implements an `Ellipse` class with methods for calculating properties like center, eccentricity, focal length, and area.

### Line.cpp

Defines a `Line` class with functions for determining its length and slope.

### Rectangle.cpp

Implements a `Rectangle` class providing functionality to compute its area, perimeter, and diagonal length.

### Square.cpp

Contains the implementation of a `Square` class with methods for calculating area, perimeter, and diagonal length.

### Triangle.cpp

Implements a `Triangle` class with functions for computing area, perimeter, semi-perimeter, in-radius, and circum-radius.
